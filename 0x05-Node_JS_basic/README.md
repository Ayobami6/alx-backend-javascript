## NodeJs Basics and Express

This project is an introduction to NodeJs and the Express framework. It covers the following topics:

* Installing NodeJs
* Creating a NodeJs project
* Writing your first NodeJs app
* Using Express to create a web server
* Handling requests and responses
* Using middleware
* Deploying your app to Heroku

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nodejs-basics-and-express.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, open the project in your favorite code editor.

## Installing NodeJs

NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment that can be used to create both server-side and client-side applications. To install NodeJs, follow the instructions on the [NodeJs website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Creating a NodeJs Project

Once you have installed NodeJs, you can create a new project by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm init
```

This will create a new directory called `my-project` and a file called `package.json`. The `package.json` file is used to define the dependencies of your project.

## Writing Your First NodeJs App

To write your first NodeJs app, create a new file called `index.js` in the root directory of your project. In this file, you can write your JavaScript code.

The following code is a simple NodeJs app that prints "Hello World" to the console:

```
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

To run this app, use the following command in your terminal:

```
node index.js
```

## Using Express to Create a Web Server

Express is a popular web framework for NodeJs. It makes it easy to create web servers and handle requests and responses.

To use Express, install the `express` package by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install express
```

Once you have installed Express, you can create a new web server by using the `express()` function. The following code creates a web server that listens on port 3000:

```
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.listen(3000);
```

## Handling Requests and Responses

Express uses middleware to handle requests and responses. Middleware is a function that is executed before or after a request is handled by the application.

To add middleware to your app, use the `use()` method. The following code adds a middleware function that prints the request method and path to the console:

```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request method: ${req.method}`);
  console.log(`Request path: ${req.path}`);

  next();
});
```

## Using Middleware

Middleware is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

* Logging requests and responses
* Authenticating users
* Parsing request data
* Generating responses

## Deploying Your App to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy and host your NodeJs apps. To deploy your app to Heroku, follow the instructions on the [Heroku website](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-getting-started).

## Conclusion

This project has provided you with an introduction to NodeJs and the Express framework. You have learned how to install NodeJs, create a NodeJs project, write your first NodeJs app, use Express to create a web server, handle requests and responses, and deploy your app to Heroku.
