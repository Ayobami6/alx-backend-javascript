| 0. Keep every promise you make and only make promises you can keep | Write a function named `getFullResponseFromAPI`. It should accept no arguments and return a promise.

It should return a Promise. When the type is `SUM`, the function should return the sum of `a` and `b`. When the type is `SUBTRACT`, the function should return `a` subtracted from `b`. When the type is `DIVIDE`, the function should return `a` divided by `b`. When the type is `DIVIDE` and `b` is equal to 0, the function should return the message `Error: Cannot divide by 0`. When the type is `SUM` or `SUBTRACT`, the math function should be wrapped in the `calculateNumber` function and called using `await`. |
