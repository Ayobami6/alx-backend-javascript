## Unittest in Javascript with Mocha

This project demonstrates how to write unit tests in Javascript using the Mocha framework.

### Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unittest-in-javascript-with-mocha.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies for this project, run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

To write a test, create a new file in the `tests` directory. The file name should be prefixed with `test-`. For example, to create a test for the `add` function, you would create a file called `test-add.js`.

In the test file, you can import the functions that you want to test. For example, to import the `add` function, you would use the following code:

```
import { add } from './index.js';
```

You can then write your tests using the Mocha framework. For more information on how to write Mocha tests, please refer to the [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/).

### Debugging Tests

If you are having trouble with your tests, you can use the Mocha debugger to help you track down the problem. To enable the debugger, run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run test:debug
```

This will start the Mocha debugger in the browser. You can then use the debugger to step through your tests and see where the problem is occurring.
